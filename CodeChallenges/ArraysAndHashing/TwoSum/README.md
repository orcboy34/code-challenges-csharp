# Challenge: Contains Duplicate

## Source

Original problem: [Two Sum](https://neetcode.io/problems/two-integer-sum/question)

## Problem Summary

Determine if any two integers in array `nums` can sum to a given target integer. Return the indices of the two integers within the array, not the integers themselves.

## Assumptions and Constraints

- You cannot re-use an element, so `[2,2]` would be invalid even if `nums[2]` was half the target value.
- There will be at least 2 elements in the input array.
- There will be exactly one pair of indices whose values sum to the target.
- The returned indices must list the smaller index first.
